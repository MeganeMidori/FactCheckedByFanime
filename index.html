    <h1>#FactCheckedByFanime</h1>
    <div class="container">
        <p>Since February, there have been numerous complaints lodged by former members of Fanime staff against the
            policies and working conditions within the con. This conversation has been largely one-sided, as many
            current staff are either afraid to rock the boat, unsure how to respond, or simply busy preparing their
            events.</p>
        <p>While many of these complaints are valid, there have also been many rumors, factual inaccuracies, and
            statements with missing context.</p>
        <p>The goal of this website is NOT to slander those who have made the difficult decision to leave, but to
            encourage balanced discussion of the issues presented so that everyone can form their own fully informed
            opinions on the issues.</p>
        <p>By leaving staff, the people running #failedbyfanime have largely abandoned the avenues available to them to
            improve Fanimecon and its community. Nevertheless, it is my hope that through open discussion the remaining
            Fanimecon staff and leadership can properly respond and improve.</p>

                former Fanime staff are their own and do not represent the Fanimecon organization as a whole.</b></p>
        <h2>Is Fanimecon 2024 still on?</h2>
        <p>There is a lot of talk and rumors online about whether or not Fanime 2024 is even still happening. While the
            recent resignations and drama have been alarming, I can assure you for every staff member who has dropped
            there are a dozen more working our butts off to make 2024 even better than last year. Below is a status
            check doc that department heads are encouraged to contribute to with your department's status and what
            guests of fanime can look forward to from your department.</p>

        <h2>#FailedByFanime's Open Letter</h2>
        <p>On March 2 I became aware of the <a href="https://failedbyfanime.com/">failedbyfanime.com</a> website. The
            google document below is a copy of the website's contents. Several people have already pointed out factual
            errors in their letter. If you see something in the letter that is false, or you have additional context
            around any items, please add your comments to the google doc below!</p>

        <h2>How can you help?</h2>
        <b>1. VOLUNTEER!!</b>
        <p>Fanime has just suffered a massive blow to both the gaming and cosplay gatherings departments, and we have
            only been given 3 months until con to recover. Not only that, but we have been chronically understaffed
            since returning from the pandemic. We all just want to put on the best event that we can for a community we
            deeply love and care about, and without staff to rebuild there is no chance of improvement.</p>
        <p>If you truly care about making things right within Fanime, there is no better way to enforce change than
            joining staff. The chair team regularly calls for new "chair interns" and bring new faces into upper
            leadership. I can't think of a more effective way to bring about the change you want to see.</p>
        <b>2. Contribute to this page</b>
        <p>By bringing all the information to light, it will better help everyone to form a less biased opinion, and it
            will help the convention staff focus on the things that truly do need improvement</p>
